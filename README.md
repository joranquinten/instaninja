This is a repo that builds an electron app for Mac. The purpose of the app is to make it as easy as possible to generate [Instagram](https://instagram.com) ready images out of source files (targeted at swipeable panoramas).

## About the app
### How it works

When you upload an image, the file will get analysed by the software which outputs it as a square image by taking in the longest dimension and providing a blurred instance of the image as a background. If the image is recognized as having an aspect ratio higher than 2:1, it calculates the optimal distribution of squares to split the image into.

As shown in this example:
![InstaNinja preview screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joranquinten/instaninja/main/docs/assets/screenshot-01.png)

For the cover image, you can optionally select the type of backdrop (blurred by default, black or white).

If you are pleased with the projected output, simply click the **Unleash _n_ ninjas** button and select and output base file:

It wil start the generating process and automatically generate any required slices (as indicated by the preview) in the target location as well.

So you go from:

To this:

And also this:

You can then manually upload those to Instagram.

### Download

You can grab the [latest version here](https://github.com/joranquinten/instaninja/releases/latest). Mac users may need to ignore or manually enable the unsigned app warning before it'll work. If you have trust issues, you can check the code and build it yourself on (at least) any MacOS platform by following the "Running the project" steps.

## About the project

The reason I've built this project is because when I wanted to upload panoramic images on Instagram, I found it annoying to either:

- Open PanoramaCrop on my phone, provide an image, select the squares: export. Upload the image, select a blurred square: export and hope the application doesn't crash ðŸ¤ž (for me it usually did)
- Manually go to the [Online Blurred Frames Images Generator](https://pinetools.com/blurred-frame-images-generator), upload my image, set the blur. Don't forget to scale down (otherwise it crashes) and export to a file. Then go to [ImageSplitter](https://postcron.com/image-splitter/en/) and upload the same source image, provide the number of squares and ...ugh

Although both methods work (usually), I've found it very tedious since on my feed, I *always* want a blurred image to precede the squares. I always need to manually recreate them. Since I'm a developer I thought, what the heck, let's build something for me then. And I did.

It's not polished and it doesn't give me the options of aligning the generated squares, but it does offer sane default that work **for me**. If they do for you too, feel free to use this program yourself! ðŸ––

### Tooling

This project is built with Electron and VueJS and it's fairly easy to modify to you liking. It uses the `sharp` library for all of the image magic ðŸŽ© and Vuetify for quickly scaffolding an interface.

Follow the steps below to get your own instance up and running. If you feel like contributing, please feel free to [contact me](mailto:joran@joranquinten.nl).

I happen to use `yarn`, but I'm sure you can figure out the `npm` counter parts for the following commands.
## Project setup

To setup the project, clone the repository to your local machine and in the folder (from the terminal) execute:

```
yarn install
```

This will install all of the dependencies to the local folder.

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

In order to develop, it's just as easy to spin up an electron instance with the following command:

```
yarn electron:serve
```

It offers the same dev tools you'd use for web development and has hot reloading enabled, so development is just as easy as coding in VueJS is!

### Compiles and minifies for production

If you want to build an application out of the source code, kill the development command and enter the following:

```
yarn electron:build
```

For this, you may need a while and also, you might run into notifications about being an Apple developer and having some sort of development ID. If all succeeded, a `.dmg` file (among other things) has been generated in the `dist_electron` folder. That's it! ðŸ‘Œ
